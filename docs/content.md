# Content Management Guidelines

This document provides guidelines for managing content on the Evolution Hub website.

## Introduction Text

The introduction text on the index page is available in both German and English. When updating this text, ensure that both language versions are updated accordingly and that the content remains consistent in meaning and length.

## Heading Hierarchy

The website follows a strict heading hierarchy to ensure proper semantic structure and accessibility:

- H1: Page title (defined in the BaseLayout component)
- H2: Main section headings (e.g., "Powerful Features")
- H3: Subsection headings within main sections
- H4-H6: Further subheadings as needed

When adding new content, always use the appropriate heading level to maintain this hierarchy.

## ARIA Labels

All interactive elements (links, buttons, form elements) should have descriptive ARIA labels to improve accessibility for users with assistive technologies. ARIA labels should be concise and clearly describe the purpose or action of the element.

Examples of elements that should have ARIA labels:

- Navigation links
- Call-to-action buttons
- Form submit buttons
- Links to external resources

When adding new interactive elements, ensure they include appropriate ARIA labels.
