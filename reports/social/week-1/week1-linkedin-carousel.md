Language: EN only

- Slide 1 (Title)
  Why we chose Astro + Cloudflare Workers for Evolution Hub
- Slide 2 (Problem)
  Global users, strict security, fast iteration — without a heavy SSR footprint
- Slide 3 (Astro)
  Islands architecture → smaller bundles, control over hydration, great DX
- Slide 4 (Edge/Workers)
  Compute close to users → lower latency, scalable “serverless” ops
- Slide 5 (Security)
  Middleware: strict headers, same‑origin, CSRF on unsafe methods
- Slide 6 (APIs)
  Zod validation + uniform JSON errors; OpenAPI as curated spec
- Slide 7 (Data/Storage)
  R2 (assets), KV (usage/jobs), D1 (auth/audit) — clear separation of concerns
- Slide 8 (Reliability)
  Rate limits with Retry‑After; CI smokes; health checks
- Slide 9 (Trade‑offs)
  Edge isn’t magic — we keep complexity low, document decisions
- Slide 10 (CTA)
