# Cloudflare Tunnel config for exposing local Cascade MCP server securely
#
# Steps (once):
#   1) cloudflared tunnel create cascade-mcp
#   2) cloudflared tunnel route dns cascade-mcp mcp.example.com
#   3) Edit this file: replace values for `tunnel`, `credentials-file`, `hostname`, and `service`.
#   4) Run: ./scripts/cloudflare/start-mcp-tunnel.sh
#
# Protect the hostname with Cloudflare Access (App policy). Use a Service Token for non-interactive clients.
# The origin (local MCP) stays private; all traffic passes through TLS and Access at Cloudflare edge.

# Replace with the tunnel name or UUID created in step 1
# You can find the UUID under ~/.cloudflared/<name>.json after creation
# tunnel: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
# or
# tunnel: cascade-mcp

ingress:
  - hostname: mcp.example.com        # replace with your hostname under your CF zone
    service: http://127.0.0.1:8711   # replace with your local Cascade MCP server URL
  - service: http_status:404

# Optional: if you prefer referencing the credentials explicitly
# credentials-file: ~/.cloudflared/cascade-mcp.json
