# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

This directory stores lightweight decisions with context, options, and outcomes.

- Naming: `NNNN-title-with-dashes.md` (incremental number, lower-case title)
- Structure: Title, Status, Context, Decision, Consequences, References
- Scope: cross-cutting concerns (security, infra, data), significant feature approaches

Templates/tools may be added later; for now, add ADRs as needed.
